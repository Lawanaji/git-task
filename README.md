# 1. Version Control:
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It helps track modifications to code, documents, and other files, enabling collaboration among multiple users. Version control systems allow you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and merge modifications made by different users.

# 2. Difference between Git and GitHub:
Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your code. It runs locally on your computer and does not require a constant connection to a central repository. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.

# 3. Three GitHub Alternatives:

GitLab
Bitbucket
SourceForge

# 4. Difference between Git Fetch and Git Pull:

git fetch: Retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository but does not merge them with your local branch. It only updates the remote tracking branches.
git pull: Retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them with your local branch.

# 5.  Git Rebase:
Git rebase is a command used to change the base of a branch by reapplying commits on top of another base branch. This results in a linear project history, which can make the commit history cleaner and easier to understand.

the command => git rebase <base-branch>

# 6. Git Cherry-Pick:
Git cherry-pick is a command used to pick a specific commit from one branch and apply it to another branch. This allows you to select individual commits and apply them to the current branch.

the command => git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
